When to use anomaly detection:
- Very small amount of positive examples and high amount of negative examples
- When there are many different types of positive examples

When to use supervised learning:
- Large number of positive and negative examples
- When you have enough data for the algorithm to get a sense of what are future positive examples "are-like"
