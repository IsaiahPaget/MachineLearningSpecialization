How to represent matrices in NumPy, in tensorflow we always use matrices even if it could be represented in just a simple vector

```python
# 2 columns by 4 rows matrix
#
# 12
# 34
# 56
# 78

matrix = [
		  [1,2],
		  [3,4],
		  [5,6],
		  [7,8]
		  ]
# 2 columns by 1 rows matrix aka row vector
#
# 78

matrix = [
		  [7,8]
		  ]
		  
# 1 columns by 2 rows matrix aka column vector
#d
# 1
# 3

matrix = [
		  [1],
		  [3],
		  ]

vector = [7,8]
```
