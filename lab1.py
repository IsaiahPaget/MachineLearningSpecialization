# ## 2 -  Problem Statement
# 
# Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
# - You would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits.
# - The chain already has restaurants in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
# - You also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant. 
#     - For these cities, you have the city population.
#     
# Can you use the data to help you identify which cities may potentially give your business higher profits?
# 
# ## 3 - Dataset
# 
# You will start by loading the dataset for this task. 
# - The `load_data()` function shown below loads the data into variables `x_train` and `y_train`
#   - `x_train` is the population of a city
#   - `y_train` is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.   
#   - Both `X_train` and `y_train` are numpy arrays.

# In[2]:


# load the dataset
x_train, y_train = load_data()


# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to red "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r') 

# Set the title
plt.title("Profits vs. Population per city")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Profit in $10,000')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s')
plt.show()


# Your goal is to build a linear regression model to fit this data.
# - With this model, you can then input a new city's population, and have the model estimate your restaurant's potential monthly profits for that city.
